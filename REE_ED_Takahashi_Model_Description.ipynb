    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rare Earth Elements (REE) and Chromite R&D Program at CanmetMINING mandated an investigation into the separation of REE via electrodialysis (ED) since year 3. Motivation behind pursuing ED technology was elucidated in previous Natural Resources Canada REE workshops and year-end reports.$^{[1][2]}$ REE-ED's year 5 experimental plan assessed the effect of chelating agents on LREE/LREE separations. Similarly, cascade (two-phase) separations and varying SX formulations were also explored. In the latter half of FY 2019-2020, Konstantin developed a strategy to optimize testing: employ a model to simulate the chelation-assisted competitive binding of REEs in ED processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "REE separations are difficult largely attributing to their similarities in chemical properties. The literature has previously established models for dynamic modelling of REE separation. For example, the MATLAB/SIMULINK solvent extraction model for REE separation as shown by Lyon et al.$^{[3]}$ In particular, Takahashi et al. have highlighted how their proposed mathematical model can be utilized to explain their findings in electrodialysis REE separation research.$^{[4][7]}$ Therefore, with the advent of COVID-19 resulting in the shutdown of facilities, it was an opportune time to consider this computational simulation approach.\n",

    "- The merit of the Takahashi model.\n",
    "- Reproducibility of Takahashi et al.'s findings.\n",
    "- Models/Chemometrics are viable ad-hoc tools in optimizing ED REE separation testing.\n",

Likewise, this can apply to any general binary $REE^{3+}$ and $REE^{3+}$. Ultimately, separation factor (SF) can be obtained from those computed concentrations.\n",

Separation factor was calculated by dividing the flux of the REE with higher permeation over the lower permeation REE (e.g. it would be $SF_{J_M/J_{RE}} = \\frac{J_{La}}{J_{Y}}$ or $SF_{J_{Nd}/J_{Gd}} = \\frac{J_{Nd}}{J_Gd}$, $SF_{J_{Nd}/J_{Y}} = \\frac{J_{Nd}}{J_Y}$). The relationship between flux and concentrations is displayed in equation 16.\n",
